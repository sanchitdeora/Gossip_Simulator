# Gossip-Simulator
Distributed Operating System - Project 2

## Problem Definiton
Gossip type algorithms can be used both for group communication and for aggregate computation. The goal of this project is to determine the convergence of such algorithms through a simulator based on actors written in Elixir. Since actors in Elixir are fully asynchronous, the particular type of Gossip implemented is the so-called Asynchronous Gossip.
